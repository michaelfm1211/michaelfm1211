### Aloha

i dare github to let me put an iframe here and to install xogOS on their main
servers. i write in nodejs/js (for web stuff) and c (for nearly everything else,
but sometimes python's just more convenient). if you've made a new language, i
don't like it. i also have some good gists. look at them.

if you're running windows, have a fun time running anything i write :)
